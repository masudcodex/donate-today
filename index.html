                    <h3>Their lives depend on your donation</h3>
                    <p>Ukraine’s 7.5 million children are caught in the middle of this war, and face grave risk of direct harm, displacement, family separation, trauma, loss of family income, and prolonged interruption of their education. The risk to their mental health and the potential for long-term trauma cannot be underestimated. These burdens are far too big for any child to shoulder alone.<br>
                    Your support will help us provide lifesaving assistance such as food, water, cash transfers, and safe places for children as people flee the conflict amid freezing temperatures and brutal conditions. Thank you!</p>

                    <p>The war in Syria is entering its tenth year; almost a decade of violence, fear and displacement for millions of children in Syria. For so many children, war is all they have ever known; it is their new normal. They play their games, learn and cherish their dreams while constantly hiding, on the run and living in tents, bombed out cities or on the side of the road. 5 million children are now in need of urgent and ongoing humanitarian assistance.<br>
                    Save the Children is doing whatever it takes to ensure every child has a place to call home, a childhood and a future to believe in. Join us.</p>
